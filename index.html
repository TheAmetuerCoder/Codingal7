                    <h1> Facts on Writing </h1>
                    <p> 
                        Writing may be defined as any conventional system of marks or signs that represents the
                        utterances of a language. Writing renders language visible. Whereas speech is ephemeral,
                        writing is concrete and, by comparison, permanent. Both speaking and writing depend upon the
                        underlying structures of language. The following is a brief description of five qualities of 
                        good writing: focus, development, unity, coherence, and correctness.

                    <p>
                        Writers use facts to support their arguments, make their writing credible, and provide readers 
                        with other sources of information. Writers should always fact-check their information to 
                        ensure their writing is trustworthy.
